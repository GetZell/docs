## Overview

Create personalized AI bots that simulate real customer interactions for training your team. Each bot can have a unique persona, communication style, and scenario focus to provide diverse practice experiences.

## Creating a Persona

A persona defines the character and background of your bot. This is the first step in creating a realistic training experience.

### Persona Fields

When creating a persona, you'll define:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Background Information">
    - **Job Title:** The role of the person (e.g., "VP of Sales", "IT Manager")
    - **Industry/Company Description:** The business context (e.g., "B2B SaaS in healthcare")
    - **Company Size:** Startup, Small, Medium, Large, or Enterprise
    - **Age Range:** Optional (e.g., "35-45")
    - **Location:** Optional geographic location
  </Step>

  <Step title="Objections & Context">
    - **Objections:** Common concerns or pushbacks they typically raise
    - **Problems to Solve:** What challenges they're facing
    - **Current Solutions:** What they're currently using
    - **Goals:** What they're trying to achieve
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Groups">
    - Optionally assign the persona to a group for organized access
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a Bot

Once you have a persona defined, you can create a bot that uses it for training scenarios.
